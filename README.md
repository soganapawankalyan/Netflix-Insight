# 🩺 Injury Insights Dashboard – Tableau Project

## 📌 Overview
This Tableau project focuses on analyzing on-the-job injury data to identify patterns, uncover high-risk areas, and recommend targeted strategies for safety improvement. The goal is to help safety teams prioritize interventions, improve compliance, and reduce injury rates across departments.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** – Data visualization and interactive dashboard development  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning and preparation  
- **Data Source** – Simulated/institution-provided injury dataset

## 🔍 Key Features
- **KPI Cards** summarizing injury count, recordables, and severity
- **Injury Trend Line** tracking incidents over time  
- **Department-wise Analysis** of injury volume  
- **Body Part & Nature Analysis** to determine most affected areas  
- **Cross-tab Visuals** like Injury Cause vs. Injury Nature  
- **OSHA Recordables** comparison chart  
- **Interactive Filters** for date range, injury type, and department
